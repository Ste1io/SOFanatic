## About

A very minimal but effective Chrome Extension I threw together to automate the daily task of visiting StackOverflow each day. This allows one to earn the [Enthusiast (30 consecutive days)](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/71/enthusiast) and [Fanatic (100 consecutive days)](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/83/fanatic) badges without actually doing anything.

## Usage

- Clone or fork this repo
- Open Chrome's [Extensions](chrome://extensions/) url in a new tab.
- Enable the "Developer Mode" toggle in the top right
- Click the "Load Unpacked" button, and select the directory for your local clone of this repo

As long as a Chrome process is running on your computer, the extension will ensure that StackOverflow gets their precious visit from you even if you forget to go there yourself.
